# Tracking-And-Speed-Limiting-In-Vehicle-Using-RFID-And-LoRa

In this project, I have come up with a prototype to solve the problems in speed controlling of vehicle and communication in the highway by having RFID tags be embedded to each and every speed limit board so that when the vehicle arrives in a particular speed zone the RFID receiver embedded in each vehicle should receive the tag information, which limits its maximum possible speed. The LoRa transmitter installed for emergency cases would enable the drivers to send information, which includes the current location from GPS and vehicle number to the authorities for providing emergency help.
